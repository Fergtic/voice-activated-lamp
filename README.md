# voice-activated-lamp

This was a test to see if I could use the google speech api, which was a pain to set up but was eventually really cool to see come up and work. Works by checking what the mic input is and when one of the selected words is detected, a message is sent over the serial port to the arduino and the relay is connected, completing the lamp's circuit, turning it on or off
